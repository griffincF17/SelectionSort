# SelectionSort
This is my implementation of the selection sort algorithm (in Java).

**Steps in selection sort:**
 1. In each run, look through each element in the unsorted subarray to see which value is the smallest.
 2. Place the smallest element at the end of the sorted subarray.
 3. Do this for each run until every element has been sorted.
